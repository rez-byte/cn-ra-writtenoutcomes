<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website, are you happy with tools you used?</h3>
<p>Having dabbled in different code editors before such as codepen an online open-source code editor a friend had advised me to try, moving to Visual Studio Code was a very easy and simple choice that didn’t have much of a learning curve it was very intuitive and easy to use. Especially the built in troubleshooting software that I had mentioned earlier, came in quite handy almost all the time. Though some newer and more different approaches to working, at least for me came from the use of Trello to plan ahead the development of my website. This was quite new to me sand at times could be stiffing, trying to think of every function and objective my website needed before hand and bullet pointing and listing everything took longer than I had expected. But whilst using it, later along the line it became very evident how useful it had been and how easily it improved the flow of production for building the website itself. </p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>2.2 Describing whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
<p>I feel like the utilising Visual Stuido Code for the development of the website was a very appropraite choice, VS code had already pre installed both HTML and CSS and as a code editor backed by Microsoft it was more secure and well maintained than some other code editors. In terms of new tools like Trello I can't say much personaly other than it did seem to ease the flow of work so I believe it did improve production I wouldn't really be able to say how much without further use. Which I look forward to since for Trello use I would consider myself to still be a beginner, though it was very effective in displaying the Kanban system.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
<p>With how my website turned out I can't say I'm exactly displeased with it, I feel that it has a nice and clean, modern look to it but can seem quite visually lacking or for a lack of a better word just empty. I feel that if had used Trello to properly organise time for more CSS alterations to the website it could’ve turned out a lot nicer. But since the website is functional and the code does what I had planned for it to do and meets it’s outcomes I can’t complain. <br><br>Having more time though I would have like to used one of the scrolling effects I had researched on W3 schools called the ‘parallax scroll effect’, which allows the background content to move at different speed than the foreground content which in this case would be this text bubble.</p>


<br><br><br><br>
<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to you project</h3>
<p>Having further time to improve the website I would’ve like to develop a better navigation bar perhaps one with a functioning drop down menu that would’ve taken you to more specific parts of the pages. And the develop buttons and icons for my hyperlinks and for the contact me page, for example an idea I had later on to to add a Twitter or LinkedIn button that would redirect the user directly to my accounts on either respective website. <br><br>
    And whilst I am happy with my layout choices I would've liked to effectively apply Flexbox to all of my pages so as to make website more responsive and able to better adapt to browsers on the differnt devices and screens though for now it does effectively adapt well to webpages on computers.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirement and are fit for purpose</h3>
<p>In conclusion I believe I have effectively answered the unit outcomes and feel that whilst improvements could be made overall. The website itself is able to the match the requirements that were determined by the unit and clearly functions for it's purpose effectively, and without any errors.</p>
