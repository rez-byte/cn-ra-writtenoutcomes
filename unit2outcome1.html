    <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
<p>The primary content of the website consists of a written blog-like excerpt about myself, my background and why I chose to join CodeNation. And the journey that followed the creation of this website and understanding of the way in which Information technologies currently affects our industry and others.<br><br> In terms of the layout of the website I tried to keep and clean consist design that was easy to read go through, each page has a navigation bar at the top allowing one to return to any previous page or other pages consisting of individual unit outcomes per page; unit 1 outcome 1, outcome 2, outcome 3, then unit 2 outcome1. Additionally I’ve utilised the index page as the home screen/about me page where I’ve written a short profile about myself and lastly I have a contacts page with a hyperlink to my LinkedIn profile.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
<p>Copyright and other intellectual property laws can affect my website because it can restrict what I'm able to publish.  The best way to get around this is either, get permission from the original artist, or, if I wanted to publish something on my site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site. <br><br> Copyright itself can actually be applied to a number things other than just images and if your not careful about how you use somebody else's image they could take legal action against, and speaking of a person's image photograph of people themselves can request for you to remove said image thanks to GDPR laws, but there are supposobely work arounds to this since they would have to prove their identity or perhaps some kind of ownership of the image, even if they haven't taken the image themselves they could potentially do this if they themselves are in the photo. Although you should'nt have trouble finding royalty free imagery on the internet or imagery and photograph that have license which allows you to use it as long as your not doing so in a commercial manner.</p>

<h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>
certain access issue have already been dealt with, thanks to some mobile and computer devices built-in software that can read text aloud for example, if the person navigating through your website was blind. But there should effectively be many ways in which somebody could code their webpages to be more accessible but the issue here could be that your methods might not recognised or widespread enough that the person utilising them methods wont understand what it means. An idea could be on a mobile device perhaps ones with haptic feedback on their screens could guide them through the pages notifying them when their over a link perhaps and then the phone would read it aloud, but a glaring issue with this would be the kind of devices you have not to mention the website may have to ask for permission from the phone before it's allowed to utilise such a feature.

<h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
Most images on websites use either raster or vector file types, and within them are JPEG's, GIF's, PNG's and SVG's well this only 4 examples but all these are, are different ways that image has been compressed and all four of them above are whats considered the best for web use. But a website can hold many different file types not just limited to the four above, from zip and rar files, executables files these are the kinds of files normally take up a lot of space and are used to download software but you need to be incredibly careful and make sure you trust otherwise an executable file must never be opened. My website itself uses a GIF for the background image and the webpages themselves were all written in HTML so that mean the file type it belongs to would get listed as .HTML or .HTM the visual elements that hold together the HTML files that also used on my website is called CSS.
