<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>

<br><br>
<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm a visual communication graduate and avid design nerd and have trained in both traditional & digital mediums. I've really enjoyed my work as designer, however limited to freelance work. This is of course partly due to the current and ongoing conditions that have effected all of us, but through this I have been granted an oppurtunity to do something I had thought about in length and aspired towards, but was never able to fully commit to till now.
<br><br>
I like to believe I'm a capable designer thanks to my time at university, there I was able to learn strong teamworking skills and thanks to all the live briefs and design competitions we encouraged to taken on I was able to develop good timekeeping skills and learned the importance of being able to effectively keep to a deadline. So feel free to contact me for any of your design needs be it; ux designs, print, brand design and even for any of your preliminary market research needs.</p>

<h3>My interest in technology and coding</h3>

<p>Technology has always been a part of my life as someone born in the 90's but it was also something very new, so not readily available or easily accessible but I always tried, from after school ICT classes, to going to the library and bugging the I.T guy and everyone else to show me how to use the internet (mind you this was back when there was no decent search engine or people actually didn't yet realise how to use one).
<br><br>
When I got my first pc, a dell tower from my mom's office that was going to be thrown away, I was told to wait till a since someonelse would've had to come by and set it up so instead I ended up taking it apart and figuring it out for myself, I remember wiring it up on the floor of my room because it was too heavy to pick up. And to this day I can still remember the look on my mother's face when she walked in on me lying on the floor playing minesweeper (pro tip, whilst I got lucky the first time around you know since I was on the floor ALWAYS be grounded wear an anti-static band or touch a powered-down power supply). As I got older my fascination for techonology never lessened just the opposite but I never really though about codign itself it was just something itself that existed and worked in the background, whilst funnily enough having thoughts like I wish I could build a website like that or an app or build some game.</p>


<br><br>
<h3>The reason I joined Code Nation</h3>
<p>Simply put it was something that was festering underneath all a long. From my time at university where I realised whilst sure I could design a website, I would'nt be able to ever build one, not alone at least (though thanks to this I made some really good friends). But it still felt quite alien despite a few forays onto the coding scene. But it wasn't until I had to apply for universal credit due to the aforementioned conditions ongoing in the country right now, one of the work oppurtinites I was closely following, that was meant for recent graduates quickly fell through and I had difficutly finding much freelance work on mine to 'bide the time' so I signed up for universal credit and whilst talking with my work coach I was advised based on all the things I had talked with them about, to seek out this course.
<br><br>
It was pracitally a god-send during these not so easy times, plus it helped that I was placed in such a great class with such great personailties and just a willigness to actively help one another, and of course Jay, a man beyond his years in knowledge that will always take the time to go over any materials or questions we have, with a saintly patience or any snarky mean comments that might make you feel less than for not being able to keep up an activiity or an issue. I also would like to mention how during my time through this course be it through learning and through the discussions that Jay took the time to have with all us about the more practical sides of coding and it's real life applications I think the goals and ambitions that I came onto this course with have grown and I'm thankful for that.</p>
