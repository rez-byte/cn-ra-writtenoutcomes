    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
    <p>I could have built this website more efficiently If perhaps I had taken the time create a wireframe for my pages beforehand or perhaps spent more of my research time together with my initial planning process. When building up this website my initial planning process was quite lacking and I didn’t actually begin to use trello to keep track of what I was doing and til much later than I would’ve normally had done.<br><br> Another thing that I could’ve done whilst utilising my project to increase productivity would be to use an extension called ‘Live Server’ which is able to produce a temp live website that changes along with the saves of my project this saved me considerable time when troubleshooting and looking back at the updates website without me having to refresh the page and or have to go through my folders to find the master .html file to open it up again as I could that thought vs code now. Also I believe that we could’ve saved a lot of time by focusing on answering our outcomes had we worked on building up an adaptable website together as a team, then later on everybody could alter the sites css to match their preferences, though I feel perhaps building wesbites this way might not be any better than using a service, such as sqaurespace and the fact that everyone would be using it, would make them ultimately quite generic, like a lot of the site templates on sqaurespace.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
<p>One way in which I was able to improve my productivity was by using a free extension from the extension marketplace set up by Microsoft inside VS code. The extension I used was called Live Server and seems to be quite popular among the user of VS code and as I previously had mentioned this extension saved me a lot of time by allowing me to check the adjustments and changes I made in my code editor without having to go through a too roundabout or finicky manner, by simply displaying a live version of the site with updates as I went. This can be especially useful when using HTML and CSS as error message aren’t directly shown as they often are in python. So through this method I can see real time my errors and swiftly fix them. Another method I’ve begun quite regularly to improve efficiency is to memorise certain repeating lines of code and using its shortcuts so that I lessen my keyboard travel allowing me to to type faster and without much pause. 
    <br><br>
An example of this would be a single text print in html requires the following: first a less than & more than bracket sign with p written inside it and to end the same but with a forward slash then a p written inside. This can all be quickly skipped because of VS code's intuitive system that allows for you to simply type the letter p and then pressing tab button will complete all of the code that is at the type of the dropdown list that appears which start with the most used codes first. this applies to most parts of CSS aswell and considerably speeds up the entire process.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3>
    <p>Well as aforementioned above utilising keyboard shortcuts was likely the best method I utilised to increase my efficiency. But personally speaking other solutions I employed to increase my overall productivity and efficiency was for example typing out the majority of my text-copy into a adobe acrobat beforehand to help spellcheck my work and avoid obvious errors I could’ve made whilst typing directly into the code editor and also by using my google drive to house the files I used whilst building my website I was able to effectively edit my work on the go, with my laptop and was able to continue back at home without missing a step or having to transfer or edit any files, since I was using the same ones on multiple devices. I believe in a team-working enviroment using this method through GitHub with thier repository and comment system might even further improve on it.</p>
    
    <br><br><br><br>
    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
    <p>I went about testing my website on two fronts first, I checked on my code using the live server extension regularly to make sure none of my formatting in CSS or new lines of codes showed up with any errors or bugs. <br><br> The second method I used, involved an external product called adobe acrobat to type out any large blocks beforehand so I could spellcheck my work, since it wouldn't show up on the VS code editor platform anyway.</p>
