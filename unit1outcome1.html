<h3>1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
<p>Today, the implementation of IT into modern business models, is almost a prerequisite and something is seen as required for any full-fledged business to succeed. You can see this a-lot in the services industries, and now even more so in essential industries such as hospitals, pharmacies, municipal councils, banks, post offices and more.<br><br> And while it may not have occurred to a lot of older business models, until after the fact, we now live in a digital age where almost all consumers and products are interconnected online, primarily through their own mobile devices. And any business or service that isn't will always lose out on this ever-growing market.<br><br> One of the largest adopters of the IT business model would be retailers who now run online marketplaces, which are available to a customer 24/7, shops that literally never sleep. This kind of business not only increase the sales for a physical store locations be it a boutique or a large chains but in certain instances (like in the case for Amazon) completely negates the need for one. There is also the case to be made for customers who quite often have difficulty going in to stores be it either because a physical difficulty of reaching said location to even customers who have trouble in public suffer from anxiety around crowds or suffer from Agoraphobia, being able to consider these kinds of conditions and now cater to them will open new market revenues that previously your business wouldn’t have been able to access otherwise. Lets of course not forget the current Pandemic, where in the government has set many new conditions and regulations on physical stores to be safer which negatively impact sales , not to mention customers trying to be safe who simply won’t risk going inside a high traffic area, and online presence will allow for you business to continue sales without worry.<br><br> During this pandemic for example the business models that succeeded most were primarily or solely IT focused ones that centred around delivering a service to the comfort of one homes such as the exercise bike company ‘Peloton’ who’s sudden sales and increased memberships increased its stock prices so much they ended up getting reported on in the news and food delivery services like ‘Deliveroo’ or ‘Just Eat’ all of which equally increased in use during early lockdown periods, where some people couldn’t leave their homes at all. And even an instance wherein a company seemingly doesn't need to utilise any digital features, such as old-fashioned tailor shop. There will always be room for information technologies in the back-end of your business be it through book-keeping, online banking or more simply to connect with new and old clients.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>1.2 Describe the methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
<p>Completing a successful digital project today can be as simple as single person working off of a laptop on his daily commute. And whilst that might seem like an exaggeration with the accessibility of free tools available to everyone on the internet such as Visual Studio Code it’s actually quite easy for newcomers to enter and successful complete a digital project given some time. <br><br> Of course even those people will need some time and training to learn how to properly write and utilise specific coding languages (for example to build a rudimentary website they’ll probably need only know HTML5) which will become much easier when using the highly intuitive and free source-code editor VS Code. This coupled with free resources found online from website such as the code academy, w3schools and the ability to effectively research and use google will allow most people to develop the necessary skills to code, troubleshoot and then solve any issue they may have own their own. Of course to be successful adaptability is a most and people need to understand when perhaps one coding language might not work for a project and then switch to another. Also VS Code isn’t the only free-source code editor out there so you could use any others you might prefer.</p>

<h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website</h3>
<div class="container link">
    <a href="https://trello.com/b/NoNAySeY/my-website/">Visit the trello board I created for this project here.</a>
</div>
    <p><br><br> When trying to improve productivity I’ve found the use of a digital Trello board very useful to plan and share roles and task of any given project with my team. Products like Trello are great especially in team exercises for example Trello combined and the Japanese Kanban system was what me and my team used to organise and share updates on our tasks whilst creating our text based adventure ‘the worlds end’. It's a very effective method that utilises a system goes from; things to do, actively doing, and finally done. The Kanban system whilst easy to use when combined with Trello become infinitely more useful especially on a team project because you can grant your team cohort access to the board you create so each team member can allocate and complete their own tasks in their own time and after their down they’ll be able to instantly share this with everyone else. Another great function of using a Trello board is the activity section of the board which will grant everyone and the team leader to track in real time how and what is changed and added to the board using this feature you can create a timeline to see what tasks were finished first and by whom, which can in effect change the way you might allocate tasks in the future to help yourself improve your team or businesses productivity.</p>

<h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h3>
<p>Naturally, digital projects carry risks with them just any other project could. Though some are not the same, for example poor or a lack of internet connectivity could interrupt a project’s chance successfulness. In most work environments loss of internet access could stall communication between two developers who might be working to together to write a piece of code, and whilst they might be able to complete their own individuals tasks alone, they would still need access to the internet to share their code with one another. <br><br> Also since most digital projects require the use of computer of some kind any hardware failures and/or a computer restart, could lead to a loss of an unsaved project or piece code, which in term could lead to great loss of time that could cause a team to miss their deadlines. Most of these kinds issues of course can be solved by subscribing to a most internet providers business plan’s which would provide a more stable internet connection and better service for when you might drop a connection allowing a quicker resolution to the situation, and the use of cloud software to regularly save and upload projects off-site will allow for all your data to be protected in the case of computer failure. But these aren’t the only risk on could take, people will still need to wary of human risks in the work environment for example whilst working at home, a child could accidentally access and delete your software and even an office space you need to aware of the security of your building and the access to the outside could somebody just walk and take your information?<br><br> Any member of a digital project or company should be adequately made aware of the risks and trained against social engineering tricks and the like, to keep them safe and your project or company information private. Also a general rule of thumb most people utilising out of date software on their computers are simply more vulnerable to external intrusion and you can very easily negate this by keeping your computers always up to date and using the correct firewalls and necessary anti-virus protections to keep you safe.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
<p>Selecting the right kind of technology for the job is quite simple, and for the majority of the time will be already pre-determined by the sort of project you’ll be undertaking.

    For example a company that is work on the front-end development of a website; would only need to utilise HTML and CSS to code their projects. And to use either HTML or CSS all you’ll really need is a code editor and their literally hundreds upon hundreds of great and free versions you can find on the internet (your greatest resource), and most can be found through other coders sharing their experiences of using such software through websites like stack overflow; a website dedicated for developers to learn and share their programming knowledge. It is quite often used for easy troubleshooting, since people who’ll have had the seem issues will have either asked for help or already figured the solution out for themselves and shared a post to help other solve whatever issue they might have on their own.<br><br>
    
    When trying to decide of the the kind of systems who might need to buy or use you’ll need to consider again what kind of work you’ll be using might want to buy computers with the same operating system for all your employees so as to make the sharing of code and folders easier. When working from an office environment you might also one want to consider lending laptops to any person who might have long commutes that will need a device they can work on whilst away from the office. Other considerations to be made would be server rooms in an office, how large the space needs to be doesn’t get the correct kind of ventilation and whether or not the noise can or will disturb other occupants, it’s also good practice to have offsite backups of all your data, for which the most used solution being cloud based software. A popular option is using google cloud service with a business subscription.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h3>
<p>Some of the technologies I use such as VS Code has greatly helped me learn, thanks to it’s inbuilt troubleshooting which can and has helped me identify errors in my code that would’ve left my code un workable otherwise.<br><br> Using services like Trello have helped me keep track of my projects and allowed to use the Kanban system to make sure I have all my tasks lined up exactly how I need it, can also serve as a reminder for task that I might forgotten or have left in the back burner. GitHub is also incredibly useful in this respect thanks to the the version control system it uses on its repositories. This way in the event an error is made in the software you can go back and find and older update or version of the code that still works and this allows me to analyse the differences in my code to figure out where I might have gone wrong. Also whenever updating a repository on GitHub you can leave public comment explaining and talking about the specific update or change you’ve made to better organise your files. Another reason someone might use GitHub other to keep track of revisions to ones code would be to GitHub’s ability host your source code, and even share the your code publicly with time stamps to record that in fact your code is your own which might be useful if somebody tried to take your source code without permission and claim it as their own, you would have a public record of when you published the code onto GitHub.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
<p>As the digital market is still a new and growing industry their are many new and changing guidelines when it comes to running your business. And there are multiple organisations and .gov listed websites that maintain a detailed and constantly updated record of all these guidelines, that are dedicated to sharing all the latest news and changes within the laws with you.<br><br> Some of the more prevalent issues right now for example would be the implementation of GDPR laws in the U.K, A lot of digital and online projects will be directly affected by this since everyone on the internet basically uses and processes one an others personal data. Be it in automated function such as filing a form on a website to a profile that someone maintains on social media.
    <br> <br>
    The ICO maintains seven principles for GDPR;
    <br>
    - Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
    <br>
    - Purpose limitation
    <br>
    - Data minimisation
    <br>
    - Accuracy
    <br>
    - Storage limitation
    <br>
    - Integrity and confidentiality (security)
    <br>
    - Accountability
    <br><br>
These principles essentially allow people to help maintain the rights to their information and how this information gets used the simplest example, of this would be the right to erasure; which essentially means that any one person can request that a website delete all the personal information they have stored on their website. With these guidelines being implemented, this means that if your business was based on using the personal data clients give you then you need to tell them exactly how you would use this information and in the event that they asked to know how this information is used or for access to a copy they would get it, businesses that don’t comply to these new standards would be then fined and even possibly prosecuted depending on the severity of the violation.</p>
